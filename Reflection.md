This project is a banking application that includes features such as creating new accounts, viewing account details, listing all accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, transferring between accounts, viewing transaction history, deleting accounts, and exiting the application. The main challenge was testing the system to identify bugs while achieving at least 85% test coverage. To accomplish this, I followed the test plan I created and carefully examined the system to detect any unusual behavior.

I thoroughly reviewed the code with two main objectives: first, to identify potential bugs, and second, to locate the lines responsible for generating output. Through this process, I discovered several issues, including empty inputs, invalid input formats, duplicate values, and special cases such as account IDs ending with 7 and transfer amounts equal to or less than 500. After identifying these issues, I corrected the code and created test cases aligned with the source file to ensure accurate functionality.

From this project, I gained a better understanding of application structure and how to apply the knowledge I have learned over the past month to a real-world project. I also learned how to effectively use AI tools to assist me when facing unfamiliar concepts or challenges. For future improvement, I aim to enhance my understanding of code quality standards and improve my testing skills to ensure more reliable and maintainable applications.
